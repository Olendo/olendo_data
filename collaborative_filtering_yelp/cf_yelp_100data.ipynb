    "We compare the merits of n different recommendation algorithms side by side.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Biased Baseline\n",
    "* Collaborative Filtering (CF - Baseline)\n",
    "* Collective Matrix Factorization (CMF)\n",
    "* Content-Based Filtering (CBF)\n",

    "\n",
    "Comparing the results of the models against our baseline shows that Collective Matrix Factorization Algorithm, DeepFM Algorithm, and Wide and Deep Algorithms outperform the baseline model. The strength of deep learning approaches were showcased as we increased the size of the dataset, beating the baselines initially by .02 RMSE in 20% subsampled data but later beating them by .04 RMSE in 100% of the data. Another key advantage of the deep learning approaches were the short training time. Using 100% of the dataset, they finished training in just 800 seconds on local environment while the CMF took an equivalent amount of time for dataset subsampled down to 50% size. Additionally, the weaknesses of the baseline models were exposed when metrics that measure user experiences such as ranking, coverage, and novelty were investigated. \n",
    "While our predictive algorithms didn’t provide drastic improvements in accuracy, our top deep learning methods providing about 3% improvement versus the baseline, given the fast training time as well as its ability to achieve superior measures on metrics that affect positive user experiences such as coverage, ranking, and novelty metrics, there is a strong reason to believe that deep learning models can provide value to Yelp users in a meaningful manner. In this report, we discuss the merits of various algorithms we explored and finally propose a complete recommendation system, that employs an ensemble of data retrieval system based on user location, cold-start recommendations using the bias-based model as well as DeepFM for general recommendation.\n"

    "## B. Business Case and Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal through this exercise is to figure out the best methodology for recommending restaurants to our users. This will be largely measured by using RMSE, which measures our forecast’s error relative to the ground truth as well as ranking metrics. Additionally, we want to measure metrics that can help us assess the sanity of our recommendation and experiences of the users. We measure these using coverage and novelty metrics to ensure that there is enough diversity in our recommendations and that our model isn’t resorting to recommending the most popular restaurants as opposed to creating a truly personalized experience. \n",
    " \n",
    "There are additional considerations such as model computation time, which affects long term overhead of maintenance of the product, and model comprehension. These are important considerations for the business as inefficient solutions will add technology debt and burden to the company’s systems. Also, employing models that are well understood can help the team in getting buy-in from stakeholders. Therefore, these factors will be critically analyzed when assessing the merits of our algorithms. \n"

    "#### E.1. FIltering, Undersampling and Dataset Size Considerations\n",
    "The idea behind undersampling is to develop a smaller dataset that is representable, or partially representative of the entire dataset, and expedites the model development cycle. We utilize 20% dataset size generally across the board for fast development iteration and for computation intensive tasks such as hyperparameter tuning. However, it is critical to analyze model performance across dataset sizes since the models’ capability to handle large dataset is an important consideration if it were to be utilized in production. Therefore we investigate two other dataset sizes as well, 50% and 100% of the data size. Whereas 20% of the dataset size is used generally, larger datasets are employed to analyze certain models’ capability to handle large data as well as measure how their performance changes with larger datasets. Finally, we filter our dataset to only active users who have at least 5 reviews since there needs to be at least some data about the user for the model to perform. If a user does not have at least 5 reviews, we will be building out recommendations using cold-start methods.\n",

    "#### E.2 Train Test Split\n",

    "Train-Test split is done in a very straightforward way. We take all the users that made through our filters as described above. Then we simply take the last two reviews of the users.

This makes sense since it would be futile to recommend a restaurant in Los Angeles to a user who is in New York City. This also allows us to reduce the computation time of our recommendation, which is another key advantage we want to have when we serve our model to the users. Additionally, we measure the above two metrics on a subsample of users as opposed to all the users to save computation time, and we also only take subsample of ratings that were positive ratings since we want to measure how good our recommendations are. \n",

    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is a class of collaborative filtering algorithms. The general idea behind matrix factorization is that there can exist a lower dimensional latent space of features in which users and items can be represented such that the interaction between them can be obtained by simply dot producing the corresponding dense vectors in that space. In short, it decomposes a m*n user-item interaction matrix into two m*k and k*n matrices, sharing a joint latent vector space, where m represents the number of users, and n represents the number of items. In terms of its outcome, we are likely to observe that close users in terms of preferences as well as close items in terms of characteristics can have close representations in the latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical overview is as follows:\n",
    "Given a n*m matrix, such that . X is the user matrix where rows represent the n users and Y is the item matrix where rows represent the m items. We want to search for the dot product of matrices X and Y that best approximate the existing interactions; i.e., we want to find X and Y that minimize the “rating reconstruction error”:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (X,Y) = argmin_{X,Y} \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} [(X_i)(Y_j)^T − M_{ij}]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a regularization term, we can also get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(X,Y) = argmin_{X,Y} ½ \\sum_{(i,j) \\in E} [(X_i)(Y_j)^T − M_{ij}]^2 + \\lambda/2(\\sum_{i,k}(X_{ik})^2 + \\sum_{j,k}(Y_{jk})^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we obtain the matrices X and Y following a gradient descent optimization process. And once the matrices are obtained, we can predict the ratings simply by multiplying the user vector by any item vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Yelp Rating Challenge, we used the python surprise package to implement MF. The MF algorithm there uses the SVD approach, which is essentially \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As the way the package is designed, we tuned on n_epochs, lr_all and leg_all to get an optimal hyperparameter set, where n_epochs is the number of iterations of the SGD (stochastic gradient descent) procedure, lr_all is the learning rate for all parameters, and reg_all is the regularization term for all parameters.  \n"
